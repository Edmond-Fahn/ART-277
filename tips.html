</a><q>Fully vaccinated' means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of
being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.</q>
<h1><span style="color:orange;">Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others, including other vaccinated people?</span></h1>
<p>While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don't have a good immune
response to vaccines.</p>
<p><q>The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines.
We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these
vulnerable populations</q></p>
